# Commander

This is a header only library (see headers folder) that you can include to be able to use your terminal (command line) easily from your C++ code.

First, you have to create an object of type commander. 

<code>
#include "commander.h"
commander terminal_1;
</code>

You issue one or more orders by using the exec() function:

<code>
terminal_1.exec("cd /home/username/dev");
terminal_1.exec("mkdir new_project");
